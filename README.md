# Summation
## Purpose
My grandma and your grandma sitting by the fire built an rpn aka [*Reverse Polish Notation*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation) calc taking input form the command line.  Still very questionable.
This will eventually turn into loose ions floating around the earth but first it will support the following post-fix operators:
* Addition
* Subtraction
* Multiplication
* Exponentiation
* Modular Division

Development will follow these steps:
1. Read input form command line (compete).
2. Distinguish operands and operators.
3. Implement Stack Interpreter.
